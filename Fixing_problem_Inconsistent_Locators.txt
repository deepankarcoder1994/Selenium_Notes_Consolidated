Issue while Running the code => Instead of Cucumber it Added Tomato in the Cart


Let us see why it happened


Earlier we thought Cucumber is in 2nd Index so it will select and add that element to the cart.
But after you clicked on Brocolli this Text changed to Added.So cauliflower became 0th index,Cucumber on 1st Index,2nd Index beetroot.
So the issue is Index is changing Dynamically after brocolli is added to the cart.
So that's the reason you should not depend upon Text.So we should follow parent-child relationship

xpath => //div[@class='product-action']/button to click on add to cart button.
