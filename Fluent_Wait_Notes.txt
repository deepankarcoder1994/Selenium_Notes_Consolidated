There is another explicit wait mechanism type called Fluent Wait.


Explicit wait can be achieved in 2 ways:-

1.WebDriverWait

2.FluentWait


FluentWait finds the Web element repeatedly at regular Intervals of time untill the timeout or till the Object 
gets found.

Unlike WebDriver wait,we need to build Cutsomized wait methods based on condition.

Both WebDriverWait and FluentWait classes implement Wait Interface.


for ex.

WebDriverWait - 10 Seconds

Fluent Wait - 10 seconds, Polling 2 seconds
