Importance of Jenkins in Test Frameworks


Jenkins is a Continuous Integration tool which is primarly developed for Automation.

Scenario where it is used =>

Tests should trigger automatically without any manual Intervention.
the single command triggering that we did in maven section also should be automated.

Suppose thousands of test cases are there and you want their result 9 am in morning.
then we can create a Background job in Jenkins which will trigger all test cases to run at 2 am.
so it will hit the command automatically at 2 am.
