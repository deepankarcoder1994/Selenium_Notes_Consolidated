Lecture 118. Learning Everything about Java Streams


Stream API is a new feature available from Java 8.
By using streams we can perform various aggregate operations on the data returned from collections classes by drastically reducing the complexity of
Code.


What is Lambda Expression?

Lambda Expression Introduces the new Arrow operator -> into Java.
It divides the lambda expression in 2 parts:-

The left side specifies the parameter required by the expression, which could also be empty if no parameters are required.
The right side of the Lambda body which specifies the actions of the lambda expression.


Note :: The Aggregate operations that we perform on the collection, array or any other data source do not change the data of the source, they 
simply return a new stream.
