1.Implicit Wait

2.Explicit Wait

3.Thread.Sleep

4.Fluent Wait

=====================================================================================

1.Implicit Wait => Wait for n Number of Seconds before you throw exception.
It is declared Globally.


2.Explicit Wait => In Explicit wait you can target specific element and say to wait for 15 seconds.
It is only applicable to that specific element Only.


In real time , combination of Implicit and Explicit wait works.


3.Thread.sleep => It is a concept of Java.Suppose you ask to wait for 5 seconds and page loaded in 3 seconds then also
it will wait for 5 Seconds.
